# EmailAutomation
I created a few email automation scripts for gmail. First I created a secure key for the script on the backend on gmail. THe EmailAutomation.py file is a script to attach and encode a pdf file downlaodable on the recipients side. The whole email (subject, body text/message, and attachment) is encrypted.
As for the EmailAutomationFromTable.py the purpose was for the script to call on the csv file to know who to send the emails to as well as address them by their proper name in the greeting part of the message. The loop runs until it reaches the last address on the list.
